# GitHubAccess

# Concept
I built a web application using React, D3.js to represent the data. 

# Search Users
The application allows you to search for a user on GitHub if that user exsists then by default a circle packed graph of the users repositories will be displayed. In this graph by default the size of the bubbles coressponds to the size of each of the repositories and the colour to the language in which they were programmed.

# Change type of data that is visualised
By default the bubbles correspond to the size of the repo but the application gives you the option to switch to number of stars, number of forks or the number of open issues.

# Draggable and Tooltip
All of the bubbles in the chart are draggable and they react to each other as a result of 'forces' acting on them. They all also have tooltips to give you information about the repo that that specific circle represents.

# Seperate Bubbles by language
The colour of the bubbles corresponds to the language in which they were programmed and they can be grouped in relation to this as well.
